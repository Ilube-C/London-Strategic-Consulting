My contributions as a technical consultant for a client in need of content creation research  

As a technical consultant at London Strategic Consulting, I was assigned to a project assisting our client in developing a strategy to acquire content creators on Bilibili (The Chinese Video Giant) who they had recently formed a partnership with. Data from Bilibili is limited, so we primarily used data and research from YouTube to formulate insights. 

Our clients requested that we provide the gross merchandise value for merchandise sales on YouTube. This is a difficult figure to estimate because these sales are decentralised and not all YouTubers sell merchandise. Using academic research on influencers and published merchandise sales statistics, I estimated an upper bound for the potential gross merchandise value of YouTube (if all YouTubers were to sell merchandise) (first slide of report). Our Client then used this to demonstrate the revenue potential from merchandise sales to Bilibili.  

Additionally, I provided research to shed light on the profitability of different content categories (topic) and forms (video structure).

The python scripts I used to achieve this are in the Code folder and datasets (updated daily) are available [here]
